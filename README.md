# PyBer Analysis 
	The purpose is to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
## Overview of Project
	Using Python skills (Matplotlib) and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data. 
### Summary
	The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types: rural, urban, and suburban shown in the "pyber_fare_summary.png". Urban leads with most fares total.
"Suburban" comes after with second amount total and last is "rural" for total fare by city type. In the month of April for "urban" the price went down in fares collected but increased in "rural" area while staying about the same in "suburban".
## Results
	Based on the results, three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:
		-in "rural" as the average fare per ride increase at the end of March to April before it plateaus in the summer months
		-the opposite is true for "urban" that time is sporadic but eventually increases for the average fare per driver
		-total fare is at peak at the end of February 2019.
